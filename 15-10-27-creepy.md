To be creepy in a relationship is to do something
that indicates that you have thought too much about
something, got to more conclusions than you should
and believed on them without sharing your thoughts with
your partner.

I am guessing that this is what defines the notion
of creepiness in a relationship. But I must search
in some examples to be sure.

Example 1 (from Bones the TV series):
- She awakes up and the guy with whom she slept with
  is naked playing his bass and singing to her in a really low voice tone.
  (he obviously planned this for a long time, and acted over his fantasy)
Result: She left =].
