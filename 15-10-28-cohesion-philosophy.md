Why do I feel like I know what I am doing, and others don't?

Why I am always confident about the decision I make?

I believe in love and truth, more than anything else.

I spoke only truth for a long, long time.

I knew I was good from very young, because unlike everyone else,
I did not lie (never), and I knew it meant something very important.

I never hurt people, never forgive myself for doing so.

Because I can't lie to myself, so I can't forgive myself most times.

To forgive myself I need a good reason
- why? why I could not make it any different?

To have those answers is what make me have peace.
I know why I failed, and how to not fail again.

I think thats the answer. Why I never feel wrong.
It's because I could not rest until I knew why I was wrong.
And if I rested I would be lying to myself about me being a good person.
