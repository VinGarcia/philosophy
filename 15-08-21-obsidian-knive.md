In life you must dicover what is your hole. If you use someone else as model, your mother, father, friend or someone else you will fail in many things. To discover your hole there are two things you should do:

- You should never think you can't do something well before you really try doing it.

- You should discover the things you do well and use them as much as you can, because thats your value, that the edge of your blade.
  Use them to help other people, use them to show yourself,
  use them to reach your goals in life, and maybe use them
  to decide what should be your goals.

This way you become useful and effective, this way you will do a lot
of things better than anyone else around you would do because these are
the things you do well.
