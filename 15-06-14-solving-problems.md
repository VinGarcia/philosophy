1. You never say I am caring more with others than I care with you,
and I will never say you don't care about what I am saying to you.

2. For me the right way is always do the best we can to be better.
   There is no way better than this, so it must be the right one.

3. When someone criticise another, they must get together,
   understand the problem and then solve the problem side by side,
   as true friends.
   The problem must be seen as something from outside,
   something unimportant for the relationship.
   Never as way to offend or as some sort of revenge of one
   against the other. If its seen as that the two will never
   get together and the problem will never be understood.
