When educating the most important thing is integrity.

> The diciple must see rules so he can follow and depend on them.
If the master show no integrity there will be no rules to be followed,
except the rules of the stronger emotions like hate, fear and lust.

One of the fundamental principles to be good is the will to fight evil.

> To devote your life to undo things that evil, to hate those things
in order to promote good. And never hate things if it won't promote any good.
