Don't lose aim.

When trying to solve a problem or a discussion it is common
to accept unperfect solutions that solve the problem and are
easier to understand but diverge from your original aim.

It is important that you always check if this solution
is really what you need.

If on a discussion with your girlfriend you lose focus, you might end up
in a circular dicussion. So if you started the topic because you wanted
to express a problem, don't forget that! You must also understand her side,
but if you are going to argue something use it to go back to your topic not
away from it.

If you are arguing about politics you must have a clear goal, and understand
what is this goal. For example you can't enter a serious discussion about politics
arguing that there is no solution for the politics because everyone is corrupt.
This arguments don't accomplish any goal except if your goal is to dishearten
the efforts of the other people on the discussion.

But in a non serious discussion this argument may fit well, since everyone's goal
is just to complain about stuff and be happy.

To be true to your goals you must understand the schemes you use during the discussion.
A scheme is a set of automated behavior you do without even thinking about it.
To do that you need to remember why your scheme was built that way, and evaluate if
there is any part of this scheme that is obviously counter productive.

The problem is when you start diverging on discussions because you have
automated this behavior in your past and stopped thinking about what you are doing.
