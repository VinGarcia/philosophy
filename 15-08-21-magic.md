Magic in real world.

If we define magic as a set of laws parallel to the
laws of physics that also affect our universe and that
can be manipulated, we can say that magic exists in our world :D.

I like to think that way because feels natural and i true believe
that all literature about magic actually references one thing
people do without noticing they are doing, or even if they do
no one think about it as magic, because magic should be something unexistent.

For me magic is all about psycology, and how people interact with each other.

To understand what I call magic you must understand at least three things:

 - What is an egregora, how old and powerful they are and how they affect your everyday.
 - Believe that people thinking process can be understood and manipulated, it's not just random.
 - Understand that to know eachother you must deeply understand yourself, your reasons and your feelings.

The last prerequisite is that you must want really, really bad to
control what happens with people around you. If you don't really
care you will not have what it takes to play this game
because it is exaustive and take a lot of time.

# Reasons

The reason why I think it is a good a idea to write about it
is because I feel powerful for thinking that way. I believe
I can change the people around me from insideout without hurting them.
I know I can change myself, and protect me from damage from other people's
words, and even prevent them from not liking me.

So my objective is to build a teory to describe that way of thinking,
describe where it is useful, how to use it, and how to learn it.

Thats what I call magic.
