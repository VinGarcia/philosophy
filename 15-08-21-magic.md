Magic in real world.

If we define magic as a set of laws parallel to the
laws of physics that also affect our universe and that
can be manipulated, it will not be impossible to find magic
in the real world. The only exception is that it does not
looks like what we would expect.

Somehow I feel as everything people say about spirits,
curses and spiritual experiences is only this, some strange
system of laws that we can access with some behavior whose logic
is hard to fully understand, so people call it all just by "magic"
and don't think about it.

But my intuition about this magic does not ends there.
People have intuition and with this they know things that
they should not know.

I fell like there is a lot more things on it, things we do
everyday:

- A police officer can often tell if someone is a criminal or not,
  just by looking at them, how can they do that if they can't even
  explain it?
- We can communicate with animals with bodylanguage even if we share
  no common ancestor for an eternity.
- The same colors that mean danger to us also mean danger to animals.
- Animals can detect earthquakes and run even if they never lived
  an earthquake before.
- Sometimes we find out that we are having the exact same thought
  as other person even if we had no apparent reason to think about it.
- Why all religions have entranced states? Why people with faith
  can accomplish things that looks like miracles?

These strange behaviors happen a lot with everyone, we don't try
to explain it because seems pointless but each of this behaviors
seem to be programmed somehow on our psyche.

I believe that we have coded on our genes behaviors that takes advantage
of a twisted logic of the natural world. The fact it is twisted
is the only thing that makes it look like it is supernatural.

For me this is the real magic, there are rules in it and if we make some effort
we can learn how to understand it. I have some thoughts on it and I think
I have some answers.

For me magic is all about how concepts and ideas evolved during the
all time life existed on earth. They did strange conventions about
some things and these conventions were recorded on our DNA and on
the project of our psyche.

To understand what I call magic you must understand at least three things:

1. Ideas behave as a living creatures - they pass from mind to mind,
   changing and multipling itself, suffer a process of natural
   selection and evolve. In summary a single idea spread across a lot of people
   behaves like a bacteria colony, and interacts with other ideas in constructive
   and destructive ways.

2. Understand that the existance of an idea have strongs side effects
   on the real world. Not only the obvious ones, but a lot of effects
   that are not so easy to track or understand.

3. To understand that this model of thinking about stuff is a tool
   to see the world from a different angle. And even if it is not
   Scientific it is very coherent.

Just for reference, I use on others posts a name to refer to ideas
that are wide spread across the world and causes great effects
on the real world, I call those egregoras - as an entity whose
behavior ressembles the behavior a god. It is stronger the more
people believe in it, it may have offspring and they represent a link
between a belief and a purpose.

As an example of an egregora: The captalism is based on the belief that if everyone
sell their own work and buy stuff instead of fighting for it we'll be able
to reach the purpose of living safely in great communities.
