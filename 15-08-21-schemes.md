Based on Inside Out movie I think its a good way to start thinking about mind with 5 base drives:

 - Anger
 - Joy
 - Sadness
 - Fear
 - Disgust

To observe why a person behave you can explain her emotions with this
5 base drives. But to explain how she behave you must have more teory.

Maybe a good approach would be to do that with schemes.

An scheme is an cut from social expectations about something.
The cut can be as big as needed you talk about how one should behave
on a restaurant or how one should behave on society, the smaller
the cut the finnest is the analysis, but make it too small and
you won't have enough information to understand the behavior.

For example in a restaurant you should not eat with your hands,
you should use the fork and knive, you should pay your bill,
you should not curse the waiter or anyone else.
You should dress well, you should enter by the front door and
you should not hear other tables conversations, etc.. etc..

Now you must understand how a scheme is formed and why it is important
to be followed.

An schema is formed by a convergence of egregoras that affect people
on that enviroment. With time people discover that some egregoras
bring bad feelings and stop trusting them in this situation. Other
egregoras will bring peace and satisfation, those are remembered
and trusted on the next times people go there.

For example consider this egregora:

 - You should talk to people and be nice because this way people
   will like you. (Based on Joy)

Now if you try to apply that on a restaurant you will cause friction
with some other egregoras:

 - You should stay alert when in contact with strangers,
   because they might want to deceive, offend or hurt you.
   (Based on Disgust and/or Fear)

 - You should stay relaxed when eating, because getting alert while
   eating feels bad. (Based on Joy, related to Disgust)

This egregoras are applied on the people you are trying to communicate.
The result is that they won't like you because you are causing their
Fear and their Disgust to step forward and their Joy to step back.

There could be other egregoras on this people that might help you,
for example: 

 - If you are an adult woman - talking to handsome men on public
   places might be exciting if they know what they are doing.

 - If you are a kid, talking to others kids on public places might
   lead to something more interesting than hearing your parents talk.

The first example won't work always since even if the person is
nice looking he might be a jerk, or cause awkward situation. The
second example might work when you are young if your parents don't
mind but as you grow up playing on a restaurant becomes ofensive
to people around so you stop doing that.

In summary with time you notice that some behaviors work others not,
the reasons are due to a very complex set of egregoras interacting.
Once you learn which behaviors work and which ones doesn't you 
have succefully built the scheme you'll use everytime you are in that

One important thing to notice is that build an scheme is expensive
and people usually don't rebuilt a scheme if they can avoid it. And after a scheme is built people forget the reasons it was built.

It has several implications that usually have to do with
not noticing a scheme is not working anymore and keep insisting
in that set of behaviors. More on this on a next post.
